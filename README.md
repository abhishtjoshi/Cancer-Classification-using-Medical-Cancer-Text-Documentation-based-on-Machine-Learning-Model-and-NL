Automatic text classification of medical data is
essential for a number of reasons. Firstly, it can assist in
the analysis and classification of vast amounts of medical
data. Given the tremendous growth in the production of
medical data, this is particularly crucial. Secondly, text
categorization can increase the precision and
dependability of medical data analysis by employing Deep
learning and NLP algorithms to spot trends and
connections that human analysts might not immediately
see. The automatic organization of medical data into
predefined categories by text classification, which makes it
simpler for researchers and healthcare professionals to
find and use the data they need to support decisionmaking and improve patient outcomes, can also increase
the accessibility and usability of medical data. The medical
data can be available in the form of papers, articles,
reports, surveys, and other materials related to medicine.
Our study involved tokenizing, case conversion, stop
words removal, word stemming or lemmatization, etc.,
pre-processing phase for text documents. Furthermore,
the model building and testing phases were carried out,
and after that analysis of the result was done in evaluation
phases. In this study, we examine automated text
categorization utilizing deep learning models like LSTM,
Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Bernaulli
Naive Bayes, and an NLP model called BioBERT. Our
results show that, of all the implementations, the LSTM
model performed the best and had the maximum accuracy
of 98.88% respectively.
